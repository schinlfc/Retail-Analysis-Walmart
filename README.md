# Goal
The objective of this project is to develop a statistical model based on historical sales data. First, I use all 45 Walmart stores to derive some statistical values. Second, I use Store #1 to build statistical models in order to predict weekly sales. Lastly, I perform model selection and evaluation by incorporating different evaluation metrics.
